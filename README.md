# My-Prediction-Assignment-Writeup-
This is final project from Coursera'a course Practical Machine Learning, which is a part of the Specialization in Data Science. This project is a peer assessment and was built in RStudio, using Knitr and Markdown language published in html format. I will try to predict the manner in which six participants performed some exercises. The machine learning algorithm will be applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data and the predictions are then submitted in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.
